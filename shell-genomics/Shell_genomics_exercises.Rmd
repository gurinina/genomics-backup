## 01-introduction

## Challenge
Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information for each item 
in the directory. What is one piece of additional information this long format
gives you that you don't see with the bare `ls` command?


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

cd ~/shell_data
ls -l
 
```
## Solution



## 02-the-filesystem

## Exercise

First navigate to the `shell_data` directory. There is a hidden directory within this directory. Explore the options for `ls` to 
find out how to see hidden directories. List the contents of the directory and identify the name of the text file in that directory.

Hint: hidden files and folders in Unix start with `.`, for example `.my_hidden_directory`

## Solution

First use the `man` command to look at the options for `ls`. 

```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

man ls

```


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

cd ~/shell_data
ls -a

```
## Name of the hidden directory


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}


```

 


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}


```




## Navigating practice

## Exercise

Navigate to your home directory. From there, list the contents of the `untrimmed_fastq` 
directory. 

## Solution


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}


```


## Relative path resolution

## Exercise

Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`,
what will `ls ../backup` display?

1.  `../backup: No such file or directory`
2.  `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
3.  `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
4.  `original pnas_final pnas_sub`

## Solution
 

## 03-working-with-files

## Exercise

Do each of the following tasks from your current directory using a single
`ls` command for each:

1.  List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that start with the letter 'c'.
2.  List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that contain the letter 'a'. 
3.  List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that end with the letter 'o'.

Bonus: List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that contain the letter 'a' or the
letter 'c'.

Hint: The bonus question requires a Unix wildcard that we haven't talked about
yet. Try searching the internet for information about Unix wildcards to find
what you need to solve the bonus problem.

## Solution
`

## Exercise
`echo` is a built-in shell command that writes its arguments, like a line of text to standard output. The arguments passed to `echo` are displayed as a line of text. The `echo` command can also be used with pattern matching characters, such as wildcard characters. Here we will use the `echo` command to see how the wildcard character is interpreted by the shell.

```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}



```

The `*` is expanded to include any file that ends with `.fastq`. We can see that the output of
`echo *.fastq` is the same as that of `ls *.fastq`.

What would the output look like if the wildcard could *not* be matched? Compare the outputs of
`echo *.missing` and `ls *.missing`.

## Solution


Make sure you type this in your terminal and are not running it in markdown as you will get a different result unless you use bash.
```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

echo *.missing

```



```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

ls *.missing

```

## Exercise

Find the line number in your history for the command that listed all the .sh
files in `/usr/bin`. Rerun that command.

If you are running zsh you won't be able to do this unless you've set up your history in your zshrc. Don't worry about this question.

## Solution

First type `history`. Then use `!` followed by the line number to rerun that command.

To find commands in your history, you can also use grep:

```{bash}

history | grep *.sh

```

## Exercise

What are the next three nucleotides (characters) after the first instance of the sequence quoted above?

## Solution



## Exercise

1.  What is the last line of the `~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/SRR097977.fastq` file?

2.  From your home directory, and without changing directories,
use one short command to print the contents of all of the files in
the `~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq` directory into one file.

## Solution


## Exercise

Starting in the `shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/` directory, do the following:
1. Make sure that you have deleted your backup directory and all files it contains.  

2. Create a backup of each of your FASTQ files using `cp`. (Note: You'll need to do this individually for each of the  two FASTQ files. We haven't learned yet how to do this with a wildcard.)  

3. Use a wildcard to move all of your backup files to a new backup directory.   
4. Change the permissions on all of your backup files to be write-protected.  
## Solution

  

```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

```

It's always a good idea to check your work with `ls -l backup`. You should see something like: 

-r--r--r-- 1 your-username staff 47552 Nov 15 23:06 SRR097977-backup.fastq
-r--r--r-- 1 your-username staff 43332 Nov 15 23:06 SRR098026-backup.fastq 

## 04-redirection

## Exercise

1. Search for the sequence `GNATNACCACTTCC` in the `SRR098026.fastq` file.
Have your search return all matching lines and the name (or identifier) for each sequence
that contains a match.

2. Search for the sequence `AAGTT` in both FASTQ files.
Have your search return all matching lines and the name (or identifier) for each sequence
that contains a match.

## Solution  

1. `grep -B1 GNATNACCACTTCC SRR098026.fastq` 

2. `grep -B1 AAGTT *.fastq`

```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

cd ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/




```


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

cd ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/



```
## Exercise

How many sequences are there in `SRR098026.fastq`? Remember that every sequence is formed by four lines.

## Solution

```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}



```

Now you can divide this number by four to get the number of sequences in your fastq file



## Exercise

How many sequences in `SRR098026.fastq` contain at least 3 consecutive Ns?

## Solution

```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

```


## Exercise

Print the file prefix of all of the `.txt` files in our current directory.

## Solution


```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}


```


## Exercise

Remove `_2022` from all of the `.txt` files. 

## Solution
 
```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}




```

## 05-writing-scripts

## Exercise

Open `README.txt` and add the date to the top of the file and save the file. 

Write out the commands you would use to complete this task.

## Solution

```{zsh, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}

```

## Exercise

We want the script to tell us when it's done.  
1. Open `bad-reads-script.sh` and add the line `echo "Script finished!"` after the `grep` command and save the file.  
2. Run the updated script.

## Solution
1. 

2. Run the updated script:
```{zsh, engine.opts="-i"}

cd ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/

bash bad-reads-script.sh

```
You should see the output:

  Script finished!

## 06-organization

## Exercise  

Use the `mkdir` command to make the following directories: 

- `dc_workshop`
- `dc_workshop/docs`
- `dc_workshop/data`
- `dc_workshop/results`


## Solution


```{bash}



```

## Exercise
Using your knowledge of the shell, use the append redirect `>>` to create a file called
`dc_workshop_log_XXXX_XX_XX.sh` (Use the four-digit year, two-digit month, and two digit day, e.g.
`dc_workshop_log_2022_11_.27.sh`)  

## Solution

```{bash}



```
